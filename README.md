## 🎯 Problem Statement

Medication mismanagement is a growing health concern that leads to:
- 📉 Missed and skipped doses
- ⚠️ Consumption of expired medicines
- 💊 Incorrect dosage tracking and overmedication
- 🏥 Poor chronic disease management
- 🚨 Increased healthcare risks and hospitalizations

Many users—especially elderly individuals and patients with chronic conditions—struggle to manually track complex medication schedules.

## 🔄 App Workflow

1. **Scan:** User scans their medicine bottle or box.
2. **Extract:** App parses formulation and extracts medication details.
3. **Verify:** User confirms the auto-filled information.
4. **Schedule:** User sets the intake schedule and current inventory constraints.
5. **Remind:** App schedules offline local reminders.
6. **Log:** User logs medication intake via push notifications.
7. **Update:** System updates stock in Firestore and triggers alerts if necessary.

## 🧠 Core Alert Logic Code Snippets

```javascript
// Dose Reminder
if (currentTime === scheduledDose) {
  sendNotification();
}

// Missed Medication Escalation
if (timeSinceScheduled > 30 * MINUTES && !log.taken) {
  markAsMissed();
  notifyUser();
  notifyNurse(); // Escalated alert
}

// Low Stock Alert
if (remainingQuantity <= threshold) {
  notifyUserLowStock();
}

// Expiry Alert
if (daysToExpiry <= 30) {
  sendExpiryWarning();
}
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Considerations

- **Minimal Data:** Only strictly necessary, non-identifiable data is stored in the Firebase cloud.
- **Anonymous Auth:** Users can start tracking immediately without providing email or passwords.
- **Offline First:** Local notifications function entirely offline.
- **No PHI Storage:** No sensitive medical records are required or stored externally, complying with generic usage policies.

## 🎥 Demo Flow (For Judges)

1. **Capture:** Scan a medicine barcode live.
2. **Process:** Show auto-filled details extracting accurate data.
3. **Set:** Set a reminder for +1 minute into the future.
4. **Alert:** Receive the scheduled push notification.
5. **Action:** Mark the medicine as "taken" straight from the UI.
6. **Analytics:** Show the real-time inventory decrease on the dashboard.
7. **Edge Cases:** Manually trigger a low-stock or expiry alert to demonstrate proactive safety features.
